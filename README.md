# Sentiment-Analysis
In today's digital age, online customer reviews play a pivotal role in shaping consumer opinions and influencing purchasing decisions. The "Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews using Machine Learning" project aims to harness the power of machine learning techniques to analyze and understand the sentiments expressed in product reviews on Amazon's online platform.
This project involves developing a sophisticated sentiment analysis system that can automatically determine whether a given Amazon product review is positive, negative, or neutral in nature. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze text and extract the underlying sentiment or emotional tone of the content.
# Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of Amazon product reviews spanning different product categories. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
# Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw text data to remove noise, special characters, and irrelevant information. Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming or lemmatization are some common preprocessing steps.
